  text: The siege had been raging for nigh three weeks, before the keep of the kinglet
    Wymond of Trustenwold II. was finally threatened to be overrun. As he was fighting
    in the last defense on top of the battlements, the kinglet's thoughts returned
    to his only son, Edward, who had so far been safeguarded in the keep.
